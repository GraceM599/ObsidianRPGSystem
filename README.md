# RPG styled note based leveling system

The plugin allows the user to create quests and achievements instead of plain notes and gain experience points while gaining knowledge. There is a status page which summarizes quests and achievements in the users vault. 

The left vertical bar of Obsidian's UI gets a new button depicting three pillars which allow the user to take their first steps to leveling up. 

This project uses TypeScript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in TypeScript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does. I don't know if thats true, it makes life easier though. Update your stuff!
